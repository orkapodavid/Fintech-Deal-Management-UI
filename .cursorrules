# Cursor Rules for Deal Management App

## General Context
*   **Framework**: Reflex (Python-only full-stack).
*   **Language**: Python 3.8+.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v3).

## Key Files
*   `AGENTS.md`: Read this first for architectural patterns and coding standards.
*   `app/app.py`: Routing and layout.
*   `app/states/`: State management logic.

## Coding Rules (Reflex Specific)
1.  **UI Logic**:
    *   ALWAYS use `rx.cond(condition, true_block, false_block)` for conditional UI.
    *   NEVER use Python `if` statements inside UI composition unless determining static structure at build time.
    *   ALWAYS use `rx.foreach(list, lambda item: ...)` for iterating over lists in the UI.
2.  **State Management**:
    *   State classes must inherit from `rx.State`.
    *   Fields in State must have type annotations.
    *   Computed properties must be decorated with `@rx.var`.
3.  **Styling**:
    *   Use the `class_name` prop for Tailwind classes.
    *   Example: `rx.el.div("Text", class_name="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white")`.

## Data Handling
*   Data is currently in-memory (`self.deals` in `DealState`).
*   Follow the "Split-State" pattern: `DealFormState` for forms, `DealState` for lists/global data.

## Documentation
*   Update `docs/` if you make architectural changes.
*   Refer to `skills/` for specific tool usage guides (e.g., `uv`).
